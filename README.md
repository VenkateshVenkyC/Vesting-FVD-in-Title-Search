## Importance of Full Value Deed (FVD) & Vesting in Title Search.

**FVD** stands for **Full Value Deed**. 

In the context of a title search, the **Full Value Deed** is the most recent deed that reflects the complete transfer of ownership of a property for a specific value, typically through a sale. This deed shows the actual transaction price or market value of the property and is used to establish the property's current ownership and value.

### Importance of FVD in Title Search:
- **Establishing Ownership**: It helps determine the latest full ownership transfer of the property.
- **Chain of Title**: The FVD is often used as the starting point in reviewing the chain of title, ensuring that the property has a clear and unbroken history of ownership.
- **Legal Validity**: Since FVD reflects the real transfer value, it is crucial in legal and financial transactions, as it shows how much the buyer paid for the property.
  
### When Is FVD Used?
- **Full Title Search**: When conducting a title search, title examiners use the FVD to trace the property’s ownership history and ensure that there are no liens, encumbrances, or claims that could affect the current owner’s rights.
- **Property Tax Calculations**: The Full Value Deed is often used for determining property taxes, as it reflects the sale price or the assessed value of the property.

#### **Example**  
- **Scenario**:

### **Vesting**

---

#### **Definition**  
**Vesting** refers to the way a property is held or titled, outlining the legal relationship between owners. It specifies who owns the property and their rights, whether individual, joint, or through entities like trusts.

---

#### **Importance in Title Search**  
1. **Clarifies Ownership Rights**:  
   - Determines who has legal authority to sell, refinance, or transfer the property.  
2. **Ensures Correct Vesting**:  
   - Protects against disputes by ensuring the property is vested as intended by all parties.  
3. **Identifies Liabilities**:  
   - Ownership type impacts responsibilities, such as debts or judgments against a co-owner.  
4. **Avoids Legal Disputes**:  
   - Proper vesting ensures compliance with laws, especially in community property states like Arizona.

---

#### **Common Vesting Types**  
- **Sole Ownership**: Individual ownership of the property.  
- **Joint Tenancy**: Equal ownership with right of survivorship.  
- **Tenancy in Common**: Shared ownership with no survivorship rights; each party’s share is inheritable.  
- **Community Property**: For married couples in community property states (e.g., Arizona).  
- **Trust Ownership**: Held by a trust with rights and responsibilities outlined in trust documents.

---

#### **Example**  
- **Scenario**:  
   - A property in Florida is vested in the names of two siblings as "Tenants in Common."  
   - During a title search, this vesting is critical to determine each sibling’s share and whether either can independently transfer their portion of the property.

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Full Value Deed** confirms the legal transfer of ownership and full transaction details, ensuring transparency and accuracy in public records.  
- **Vesting** outlines ownership rights and responsibilities, preventing disputes and clarifying who can legally act concerning the property.
   
### Both FVD and Vesting are crucial components of a thorough and reliable title search process.
